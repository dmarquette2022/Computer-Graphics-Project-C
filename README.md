 Project C introduced the concept of lighting in 3D computer graphics. For this project, I learned about and encoded 4 different methods of lighting and shading. This included phong shading, gourard shading, phong lighting, and blinn-phong lighting. While learning these methods, I was exposed to the concepts of specular, diffuse, and ambient lighting. Additionally, I learned how to use different materials in my animation and shading, and deployed a library of materials that you can cycle through in the web application.
 
 In order to view the working code, simply run the .html file included in the project.
